// MGPU Bridge - the bridge thread (T3; window + message pump arrive with T4)
//
// Thread creation uses _beginthreadex, not CreateThread: this thread uses
// CRT facilities (snprintf, std::mutex, std::atomic), and CreateThread
// skips the per-thread CRT initialization. Signature (6 arguments):
//   uintptr_t _beginthreadex(void *security, unsigned stack_size,
//       unsigned (__stdcall *start_address)(void *), void *arglist,
//       unsigned initflag, unsigned *thrdaddr);
//
// The one-shot re-arms: UE5's probe cycles tear the device down two or
// three times before the real render device appears, and ReShade sometimes
// re-attaches the module without a fresh LoadLibrary ("Loading externally
// registered add-on") - statics such as `started` survive. A thread that
// exited on a probe's teardown would otherwise never be replaced, and the
// T2 selection (now deferred to the real device's swapchain) would have no
// thread left to create the T3 device.
//
// T4: the window and the message pump. A window belongs to the thread that
// called CreateWindowExW, and only that thread may pump its messages - so
// register class, create window, PeekMessage/DispatchMessage, DestroyWindow
// and UnregisterClass all happen on this thread. Nothing touches the window
// from a ReShade callback, and nothing blocks the game thread waiting on it.
// The stop event is the single shutdown signal for this thread; WM_QUIT is
// never the exit signal (a WM_QUIT in the queue would be drained and
// dispatched to nothing, and the loop would keep waiting - a hang with no
// error anywhere). The device-removal poll T3 never built is folded into the
// pump loop: a 250 ms timed wait that calls gpu1::device_removed_reason and
// logs only on the transition away from S_OK (the value is sticky once
// removed).

    // then called MonitorFromWindow to learn which panel it had landed on. That
    // is an inference from where Windows happened to place it, and Windows
    // places it on the primary display - which on the rig this was built on is
    // the GAME's panel. So the window sized itself correctly to the wrong
    // monitor, every launch, and had to be dragged across by hand. It is not
    // cosmetic: presenting GPU 1's output on GPU 0's panel is the cross-adapter
    // present the whole topology exists to avoid, and it puts the thing being
    // measured behind the thing being measured.
    //
    // THE FIX. The bridge adapter knows which outputs it drives. Ask it. That
    // is a statement about the hardware rather than a guess about window
    // placement, and it is the same adapter pointer T2 selected and T3 created
    // the device on, so the window cannot end up on a different card than the
    // neural work by construction.
    //
    // Everything here can only withhold a placement, never produce a wrong one:
    // any failure leaves the origin at CW_USEDEFAULT, which is exactly the old
    // behaviour, and says so in the log.
