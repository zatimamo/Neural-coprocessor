// MGPU Bridge - adapter enumeration and selection (T2)
//
// Brief section 06, four rules. The gates are evaluated in an order that is
// safe under partial application - every gate can only withhold a selection,
// never cause a wrong one:
//
//   [rule 2] the game LUID gate, first: a selection may proceed only from
//            the swapchain-derived game LUID (the device
//            CreateSwapChainForHwnd was called on). UE5's probe devices make
//            the first init_device untrustworthy - one run captured a
//            *software adapter* as the game LUID. init_device captures a
//            provisional value that the swapchain value overrides.
//   [rule 3] the software filter: an adapter is software if it carries
//            DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_SOFTWARE *or* reports Microsoft's vendor id
//            0x1414. The flag alone is not sufficient - a rig run enumerated
//            two "Microsoft Basic Render Driver" adapters with identical
//            vendor, device id and memory reporting different Flags in the
//            same session (0x0 and 0x2), so an unflagged WARP survived the
//            filter and made the tiebreak ambiguous. Software adapters are
//            still enumerated and logged (Flags in hex, VendorId and
//            DedicatedVideoMemory); they simply cannot be selected.
//            DedicatedVideoMemory is logged and never filtered on -
//            integrated GPUs legitimately report zero.
//   [rule 4] the output count: logged for every adapter; consulted only as a
//            tiebreak when more than two hardware adapters exist. It is never
//            the primary discriminator - this project's topology puts the
//            display on the target card.
//   [rule 1] refuse rather than guess, last: exactly one candidate or
//            nothing. Listed first in the brief because it replaces the old
//            last-in-enum-order fallback and governs every non-unanimous
//            outcome; it is the final gate before a selection is committed.
//
// The binding keys on the LUID, never the enumeration index (index order is
// not stable across driver restarts). The selected IDXGIAdapter1 is held
// AddRef'd from the enumeration itself - T3's D3D12CreateDevice takes that
// pointer directly, so no LUID re-resolution is needed.
