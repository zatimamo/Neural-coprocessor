// MGPU Bridge - adapter enumeration and selection (T2)
//
// Selection pipeline (brief section 06). The rules are ordered so a
// partial application is always safe - the swapchain-derived game LUID
// gate is evaluated before any filter, and the refuse-rather-than-guess
// gate last, so an incomplete set of filters can never produce a wrong
// selection:
//
//   1. The game LUID must come from the swapchain. UE5's probe devices
//      mean the first init_device is not reliably the game's renderer
//      (one run captured a software adapter as the game LUID). init_device
//      is captured only as a *provisional* value; the LUID of the device
//      that owns the swapchain (the device CreateSwapChainForHwnd was
//      called on) overrides it and is the only value a selection may be
//      based on. No swapchain-derived game LUID -> no selection.
//   2. Software adapters (DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_SOFTWARE in
//      DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC1::Flags) are still enumerated and logged, but
//      cannot be selected. Flags (hex), VendorId (Microsoft is 0x1414)
//      and DedicatedVideoMemory are logged so the rig can confirm which
//      discriminator actually separates them.
//   3. Refuse rather than guess. If the filter does not leave *exactly
//      one* candidate, select nothing and log loudly - a missing device
//      is diagnosable; a device on the wrong adapter succeeds, logs
//      cleanly, and proves nothing. This replaces the old
//      last-in-enum-order fallback.
//   4. Output count is never the primary discriminator - this project's
//      topology puts the display on the target card, and any rig with
//      displays on both cards breaks an output-count rule silently.
//      Output counts are logged for every adapter and used only as a
//      tie-break when more than two hardware adapters are present.
//
// Diagnostic only, must not influence the selection: per-adapter
// IDXGIAdapter3::QueryVideoMemoryInfo (DXGI_MEMORY_SEGMENT_GROUP_LOCAL) -
// this process's VRAM usage reads multi-GB on the game's adapter and
// near-zero on every other one.
//
// The binding always keys on the LUID, never on the enumeration index
// (index order is not stable across driver restarts, and the LUIDs
// themselves are reassigned across sessions).
