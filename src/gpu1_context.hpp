// content. The 64-byte seal carried in each slot is what makes them nameable,
// and section 06 committed to shipping it with the first task that transits a
// stream.
//
// Scope, so the log is not over-read: the seal proves IDENTITY, ORDER and AGE.
// It does NOT verify pixels per frame (P1.5 established the payload crosses
// byte-exact, and re-proving it per frame would measure the instrument), and
// the barcode field is written as 0 and left UNCHECKED because the shader that
// would make it an independent check does not exist yet. The neural stage is
// deliberately not attached: if both landed in one commit, a failure would not
// say which half.

// P5.2. Any thread. True only when mgpu.ini says Probes=1.
//
// DEFECT C: the one-shot probe chain (P1.3 transit, P1.5 capture and the P3.x
// ngx_probe it leads into) and the P4.1 stream both armed from the same hotkey,
// which put TWO independent NGX consumers on ONE shared parameter block -
// GetCapabilityParameters returns the core's block, not a per-caller one. The
// probe's teardown then destroyed it under the running stream. The visible
// symptom was a neural image with the colours wrong while every transport
// counter stayed clean, which is precisely the failure shape the seal cannot
// see: the bytes arrived, the consumer was broken.
//
// The destroy is now suppressed while the stream holds the block, and the
// probes themselves are opt-in and default OFF - they are answered questions,
// and re-running them under a live stream can only cost. Set Probes=1 in

// own Streamline scans the executable's folder for nvngx_*.dll and
// initialises what it finds, which binds NGX's cubin layer to the GAME'S
// adapter before this add-on's thread exists - and CreateFeature on the
// second adapter then faults inside NVIDIA's allocator and takes the process
// with it. Cyberpunk has no use for that DLL. It loaded it because 0.1.0's
// install instructions put it there.
//
// So this ranks with the GitHub line in the panel: one is where to send a log
// when something breaks, and this is the single thing most likely to be
// broken. It returns:
//
//   0  correct - a private copy under a subfolder, none beside the exe
//   1  WRONG   - a copy sits beside the exe; move it into the mgpu folder
//   2  MISSING - nvngx_dlssnr.dll is nowhere findable; neural cannot start
//
// Filesystem only. Safe to call while drawing, before anything arms, and in a

// event only fires when ReShade actually runs an effect pass. Remove the tap
// from a GAME runtime that has no other effects and the event never arrives:
// the enumeration never runs, the tap state stays at -2, and the screen that
// was supposed to say ERROR 204 sits on "ARMING" forever. Reproduced on
// Cyberpunk 2077 with mgpu_depth_tap.fx deliberately deleted.
//
// So this is pushed from the PRESENT path instead, which arrives whatever the
// effect runtime is doing - the same correction R140 made to the log, applied
// to the screen. True means: the game's swapchain has presented past AutoArm's
// own threshold and reshade_finish_effects has never once fired on it.
//
// It is a latch. It is set once and never cleared, because the condition it
// reports cannot un-happen within a process: the early return in on_present
// stops the counter the moment an effect pass is seen, so the threshold can
// only ever be crossed by a runtime that has already stayed silent past it.

// menu's flat plane of zeros from reaching the model. The CALLER issues the
// transition around this call, because ReShade owns that resource and R56
// proved ReShade's own mapping is the correct one for it.
// R78: mvec_handle is the VELOCITY BUFFER the probe published, or 0 when it
// has not published one yet. It is used ONLY at arm time, to size the slot's
// MVec region from the resource; the per-frame copy does not come through
// here, because by the time this event fires the buffer is a render target
// again. See stream_mvec_copy.
// L3. The produced-count signal, moved off the effects event.
//
// stream_on_finish_effects signals gfence for the frame BEFORE the one it is

// event fires, and L1 measured the consequence as a backlog pinned at 3.
//
// By the time ReShade raises PRESENT for frame N, that list has necessarily
