//
// One monitor, render card headless. A second window on the desktop is
// something a game engine can see, and seeing it, it decides it is no longer
// on top and locks its own input. That lock - not input ROUTING - is what
// Special K was working around. On, the bridge creates no visible window: the
// present chain is a COMPOSITION swapchain, which takes no HWND and so cannot
// be in anyone's Z-order, and it becomes the topmost DirectComposition visual
// on the GAME's own window.
//
// FOUR THINGS THAT COST A BUILD EACH. Keep them; every one arrived as "it just
// does not work":
//   - DCompositionCreateDevice cannot take a D3D12 device. IDXGIDevice is a
//     D3D10/11 interface, so that QueryInterface returns E_NOINTERFACE always.
//   - Passing NULL instead is legal, returns S_OK for every call, and DRAWS
//     NOTHING: the composition device lands on the default adapter while the
//     swapchain is on GPU 1, and DirectComposition does not report a
//     cross-adapter content binding as an error. Hence the throwaway D3D11
//     device on GPU 1's own adapter below - it renders nothing and exists only
//     to name an adapter to that API.
//   - Commit is ASYNCHRONOUS. It returns S_OK for a tree the compositor has
//     not looked at, which is how the above reported success while black.
//     WaitForCommitCompletion and CheckDeviceState are the only questions it
//     will answer about a tree it has already accepted.
//   - A windowless swapchain behind a window that is still SHOWN is not
//     windowless. worker.cpp must not show it.
//
// THE OVERLAY, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BUG. The visual is topmost, so the game's
// ReShade overlay - drawn into the game's back buffer, layer 1 - is underneath
// it. Nothing reorders that. The bridge runtime has an overlay of its own that
// IS on top, and it can never be interactive.
//
// RESOLUTION CHANGES ARE NOT THIS MODE'S PROBLEM. The arm fixes source size,
// row pitch, bands and the shared heap whatever the presentation path, and the
// shipped ini has said so in capitals since long before any of this. The one
// thing the ghost adds is that there is no window to watch go wrong, so a
// stale arm reads as a subtly incorrect picture over a correct game rather
// than as an obviously broken window. V69 commits the tree after a resize so
// the compositor at least agrees about the size.
//
// THE OVERLAY, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BUG (continued). ReShade binds a runtime's
// input to that runtime's WINDOW, and this one is hidden and unfocused by
// construction. MEASURED, so nobody repeats it: posted window messages do not
// reach it, AttachThreadInput plus SetFocus on the window's own thread does
// not either, and mirroring the cursor while pinning both panels holds the
// illusion for one panel and breaks for every ReShade window around it. So the
// bridge STEPS ASIDE instead - see dcomp_set_visible.

// P1.0b - make CreateFeature(Reserved18) succeed on the second GPU
//
// P1.0 answered the question that gated the milestone: NGX DOES stand up
// on a headless, non-game adapter. Init_Ext returned Success and
// GetCapabilityParameters returned Success against luid 00000000-0001382B,
// outputs=0. That result is recorded in P0_RECORD.md section 09 and
// VENDOR_LOCK.md and is not re-litigated here.
//
// What P1.0 left open, and what everything below exists to close:
//
//   1. CreateFeature(Reserved18) returned 0xBAD0000B in 0 ms - the NGX
//      core rejecting a feature it has no snippet mapping for. The feature
//      calls are therefore routed to nvngx_dlssnr.dll, which requires this
//      module's file name to contain "nvngx.dll" (hence the deploy name
//      nvngx.dll_mgpu_bridge.addon64).
//   2. We were blind to NGX's own diagnostics. An application-form Init
//      with a log callback fixes that; the driver's lines arrive prefixed
//      [MGPU][P1.0c][NGX].
//   3. The teardown crashed. The probe released a command list
//      CreateFeature had recorded into and that had never executed. It is
//      now closed, executed and fence-waited before anything is released,
//      and every teardown step announces itself before it runs.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
namespace
{
    // P1.0b. The first rig run settled what P1.0 could only infer: ALL
    // SEVEN entry points resolved from the core. _nvngx.dll exports
    // Init_Ext despite the header declaring it under NGX_SNIPPET_BUILD - a
    // header's preprocessor gating describes what a compiler sees, not what
    // a DLL exports. The earlier comment here said the opposite; it was
    // wrong and VENDOR_LOCK.md records why.
    //
    // What the run did NOT settle is where CreateFeature should be called.
    // The core accepted the call and rejected the feature:
    // 0xBAD0000B FAIL_UnableToInitializeFeature in 0 ms, which is the core
    // saying it has no feature->snippet mapping for Reserved18 and never
    // opening a library. So P1.0b routes the FEATURE calls to the snippet
    // and leaves the SESSION calls on the core:
    //
    //   core     Init / Init_Ext, GetCapabilityParameters,
    //            DestroyParameters, Shutdown1
    //   snippet  CreateFeature, ReleaseFeature, EvaluateFeature
    //
    // The snippet inspects its caller's return address and requires the
    // owning module's file name to contain the substring "nvngx.dll" -
    // which is why this add-on now deploys as
    // nvngx.dll_mgpu_bridge.addon64. Every snippet call therefore has to
    // originate from inside this module, and none of them may be forwarded
    // through a helper in another DLL. A caller that fails that test gets
    // 0xBAD00002 FAIL_PlatformError, which is a distinct code from the one
    // above and tells us the routing changed something.
    //
    // CreateFeature, ReleaseFeature and EvaluateFeature are ABI-identical
    // between the core-facing and snippet-facing builds of the header -

    //   1. tex_out and tex_pong are created ALLOW_UNORDERED_ACCESS. D3D12 does

    //      too many, and one extra linearisation looks exactly like the washed

    // ~220 ms feature rebuild, and that is an architectural constraint
    // rather than a detail.
    //
    // THE CONTROL. Two evaluates would only show that something changed
    // between them - NR keeps a temporal history (dlssnr_prev_output), so
    // the second evaluate could differ from the first for reasons that have
    // nothing to do with intensity. Three evaluates settle it:

        // QUESTION 1: IS THE FEATURE DRIVABLE, OR ONLY CREATABLE? Everything
        // up to here evaluates a freshly created feature two or three times
        // and destroys it. A pipeline evaluates one feature for the lifetime
        // of a session. This runs the SAME handle REPEATS times per batch,
        // twice, on one command list - and if the feature degrades, stops
        // writing, or starts failing after n uses, this is where it shows.
        //
        // QUESTION 2: THE SENTINEL SURVIVORS, AND WHY THE OLD TEST CANNOT
        // ANSWER THEM. P1.2 pre-fills each output with a fixed COLOUR and
        // counts pixels that still hold it afterwards. That test has the
        // same flaw P1.5e had: it is an ABSOLUTE match with no control, so a
        // pixel NR legitimately wrote to the sentinel value is counted as one
        // NR failed to write. The native-format run made that concrete - 1
        // survivor in A and C, 0 in B, where the converted runs had 0
        // throughout. On a packed 10:10:10:2 format the sentinel is being
        // matched against bit fields that straddle byte boundaries, so an
        // accidental match is far more likely than it is in R8G8B8A8. One
        // pixel in 3.69 million is exactly the scale of coincidence.
        //
        // THE DIFFERENTIAL TEST HAS NO ABSOLUTE COLOUR IN IT. Evaluate twice
        // at the SAME intensity, from the SAME input, into an output
        // pre-filled with 0x00 the first time and 0xFF the second. A pixel NR
        // wrote holds the model's value both times and matches. A pixel NR did
        // not write holds 0x00 once and 0xFF once and cannot match. The count
        // of differing pixels is therefore the EXACT number of unwritten
        // pixels, with no false positives possible, in any format. If it is
        // zero, the survivors were coincidence and the DLSSNR.Output rebind is
        // exonerated.

        //
        //   depth not read  -> colour only crosses. The design is what we built.
        //   depth read      -> depth must cross too. R32_FLOAT at 1440p is
        //                      ~14.7 MB against ~14.06 MB of colour, so the
        //                      per-frame payload roughly DOUBLES on a link that
        //                      is already the binding constraint.
        //
        // Motion vectors are deliberately not part of this question. P0_RECORD
        // records QuantMotion deriving flow from colour ON GPU 1 at 0.13-0.17
        // ms, and the reference tool already runs that substitution with zero
        // failures over 3000 evaluates - so flow is produced where it is
        // consumed and never crosses. Depth cannot be derived that way, which
        // is why it is the only open half.
        //
        // THE TEST IS A CONTROL, NOT AN OBSERVATION. Two evaluates, identical
        // in every respect - same real frame, same intensity, same Reset - with
        // exactly one variable: whether a depth texture is bound. Byte-compare

// P1.3 - can a buffer cross between these two adapters, intact?
//
// This is the first milestone that involves the bus at all. Everything
// before it lived entirely on GPU 1.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: touch the game's device. P0_RECORD
// section 01 records that the accessor reaching the game's D3D12 objects
// was never written, and this probe does not write it. It creates its OWN
// device on the game's ADAPTER instead - two D3D12 devices on one adapter
// is ordinary - so the only thing at risk is our own state. Reading the
// game's actual frame needs the game's device and belongs to P1.4; the
// question here is narrower and can be answered without it.
//
// THE GATING QUESTION. P0 measured CrossAdapterRowMajorTextureSupported = 0
// on this rig, so cross-adapter TEXTURES are unavailable. Shared BUFFERS
// with placed footprints are the documented fallback, and nobody has tested
// whether they work here. If they do not, the architecture changes shape.
//
// TWO PATHS, ONE RUN:
//   A   D3D12 shared cross-adapter buffer - CreateSharedHandle on the game
//       adapter, OpenSharedHandle on ours. The real architecture.
//   A'  A host-pinned heap: one VirtualAlloc opened as a D3D12 heap on BOTH
//       devices via OpenExistingHeapFromAddress, with a placed buffer on
//       each side. No CPU copy either - both GPUs DMA the same pages.
//
// A' runs only if A fails, and the log says which produced the result.
// They are worth comparing rather than merely ranking: cross-adapter heaps
// between unlinked adapters are widely believed to be host-memory backed
// anyway, in which case A and A' are two APIs onto the same hardware path.
// If their timings match, that is a finding about consumer multi-GPU, not
// just a fallback that happened to work.
//
// NO SHARED FENCE. Synchronisation here is a CPU wait between the two
// submissions - serialised on purpose. Pipelining is P2, and the
// cross-adapter shared-fence flag stays inside build.yml's containment
// pattern until then. This probe moves exactly four symbols out of that
// pattern: SHARED_CROSS_ADAPTER, HEAP_FLAG_SHARED, CreateSharedHandle,
// OpenSharedHandle.
//
// Do not name the still-guarded symbols in this file, even in a comment
// saying they are unused - the containment grep matches text, not code,
// and it is right to. It caught exactly that mistake on build #1 of this
// milestone.

        // serial's 11.48 ms over four settled runs, and never won at that

// =====================================================================
//
// P1.4 closed the loop on a pattern we generated: deterministic, well formed,
// ours. That is what made a byte-exact verdict possible, and it is also the
// last thing about the payload that was convenient. P1.5 replaces it with the
// game's finished colour buffer - 2560x1440 R10G10B10A2_UNORM here - a
// resource this add-on does not own and did not create.
//
// THE VERDICT CHANGES SHAPE, AND THAT IS THE INTERESTING PART. Real content is
// not deterministic, so P1.4's "identical to the local control" test cannot
// survive the move. Rather than weaken it to something softer ("it looks like
// a frame"), the question is split in two:
//
//   1. TRANSIT INTEGRITY, still exact. The same command list records TWO
//      copies of the same source: one into the cross-adapter buffer, one into
//      an ordinary readback buffer on the game's own device. They are the same
//      bytes by construction. What GPU 1 receives is compared against what the
//      readback holds. Byte-identical, or not.
//   2. NR CORRECTNESS on that payload - already established by P1.4 and NOT
//      re-argued here. The model is deterministic within a session and
//      produces identical output on transited input. Nothing about real
//      content changes that, so P1.5 does not re-prove it.
//
// The heap is created on the GAME'S DEVICE, not on one of ours. The game's
// command list can only reference resources from the device that created it,
// and the ReShade event hands us that list. This is the most intrusive thing
// this project does, so it is one-shot: one frame, then disarmed forever.

// Everything before this was a probe: one frame, one question, one answer, one
// shot per process. This is the first stage that RUNS - every game frame, into
// a ring of slots, for as long as it is armed.
//
// That changes what can go wrong, completely. P1_INSTRUMENT.md section 00
// lists thirteen transit failures and calls the second half of them QUIET:
// torn, stale, dropped, duplicated, reordered, slot-aliased. Not one of them
// is reachable by a one-shot probe, and not one of them is visible to a person
// watching the bridge window - a stream that consistently delivers frame N-4
// looks perfect on static content. The seal is the instrument that makes them
// nameable, and section 06 committed to shipping it with the first task that
// transits a stream. This is that task.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated up front so the log is not over-read:
//
//   - It does NOT verify pixels per frame. The seal proves IDENTITY, ORDER and
//     AGE. P1.5 already proved the payload crosses byte-exact, and re-proving
//     that every frame would cost a full-resolution readback per frame and
//     measure the instrument instead of the transit.
//   - The `barcode` field is written as 0 and NOT CHECKED. It needs a shader
//     that renders the frame index into the pixels (P1_INSTRUMENT section 03),
//     which does not exist yet. Writing frame_index into it here would produce
//     a check that compares a value against itself and always passes - the
//     exact shape of the failures section 00a records. Zero and unchecked is
//     honest; self-comparison would not be.
//   - It does NOT run the neural stage. Feeding this stream to a persistent
//     DLSS-NR feature is the next step and is deliberately separate: if both
//     landed in one commit, a failure would not say which half.
//
// SELF-LIMITING BY DESIGN. This is the first code in the project that adds
// per-frame work to the GAME'S command list, so it stops on its own after

        // writes this and stream_poll reads it, both in this file - and the
        // heap is created per-arm, so no seal outlives the build that wrote
        // it. The seal crosses an ADAPTER, not a wire.

        // lying. That is what the 64 bytes buy.
        //
        // AND THE COST OF THE SHAPE: three regions now means three sets of
        // hand-named fields and three copies of the contract check. A fourth

        // stage actually is. Measured: produced=15000, consumed=15000,

    // nothing the panel could usefully do with them at all.

    // The compromise this implements: THE PANEL WRITES THE FILE, THE SETTING
    // TAKES EFFECT ON THE NEXT LAUNCH. That is honest about the constraint
    // rather than pretending a driver mode or an R change is a live toggle,
    // and it means a user never has to open a text editor to try something.
    //
    // THREE RULES, EACH LEARNED THE HARD WAY IN THIS FILE.
    //
    //  1. LINE-ANCHORED, LIKE THE READER. A key is only a key if it is the
    //     first token on its line. A commented-out ";SRScale=50" must not be
    //     what we rewrite, or turning a toggle on would edit a comment and
    //     change nothing - which is the P1.6 stale-preset failure again, in a
    //     new place.
    //  2. ONE LINE CHANGES, NOTHING ELSE MOVES. The shipped mgpu.ini is mostly
    //     comments and those comments are the documentation. A writer that
    //     rewrites the file from parsed values destroys them.
    //  3. WRITE A TEMP AND RENAME. A half-written mgpu.ini is a game that
    //     launches with every key at its default and no way to tell (P7.2).
    //     MoveFileExW with REPLACE_EXISTING is atomic enough for this.

    // untouched. Two snippets, two features, one process - which is the

        //
        // THE DEFECT, and it goes back at least to 0.2.1. R was inherited from
        // the motion vector RESOURCE's dimensions, and then the guard below

        // the vectors were display-sized, the game "must be" rendering at
        // native, so there was nothing to upscale and SR turned itself off.
        //
        // That inference is false, and The Blood of Dawnwalker is the title
        // that says so. MEASURED 2026-09-17, from its own [R101] table:
        //
        //   quality=2                                   <- DLSS Quality
        //   NGX Width/Height 1708x961, Out 2560x1440
        //   subrect 1708x961
        //   CreateFlags=0x49 -> MVLowRes=0              <- vectors at DISPLAY
        //   velocity buffer ALLOCATED at 2560x1440
        //
        // The game declares a 1708x961 render extent and allocates its vectors
        // at 2560x1440. R was inherited as 2560, tripped the >= guard, and
        // Native Upscaling refused itself on a title running DLSS Quality. The
        // log then reported it as "the DLAA case", which is how this survived
        // three releases: the message described the inference rather than the
        // game, so every reader - two agents and the author included - took
        // the refusal for correct behaviour.
        //
        // 007 FIRST LIGHT IS NOT THIS DEFECT, and the distinction cost a wrong
        // diagnosis on 2026-09-17 before its table was read properly. It
        // reports quality=5 - DLAA - with Width == Out == subrect == 2560x1440:
        // genuinely native, so the refusal there is correct and this branch
        // will not fire on it. What made it look identical was MVecScale
        // -1280.0000,720.0000, read as if it were a render extent. IT IS NOT
        // AN EXTENT - it is DLSS's own vector-unit conversion, and the [R101]
        // note has warned against exactly that reading since Battlefield 6.
        // THE ONLY EXTENTS THAT ARE EXTENTS ARE Width/Height, Out*, AND THE
        // SUBRECT. render_w/render_h come from the subrect; nothing in this
        // function consults MVecScale.
        //
        // AN ALLOCATION IS A CEILING, NOT A MEASUREMENT. A buffer at display
        // size written only in a render-size corner is a shape this project
        // already knows - it is why table::mvec_x/sub_w exist - so sizing R
        // from the resource was always reading the wrong quantity. It happened
        // to be right on Cyberpunk and Dawnwalker because those engines

// T4 fixed the window at 1280x720 and T5 created the swapchain non-resizable,
// deliberately - "no ResizeBuffers at P0". That was right while the window's job
// was to prove the loop was alive. It is wrong now that the window is the
// product: a 1280x720 letterbox out of a 2048x1152 frame throws away three
// quarters of what the neural stage produced, and it is not what anyone would
// record a video of.
//
// Called ONCE per stream, from the bridge thread, on the first frame whose
// source dimensions are known - which is why it cannot happen at T4: the game's
// backbuffer size is not known until a seal has carried it across.
//
// Window= in mgpu.ini picks the shape:
//   crop  the P5 behaviour, unchanged. 1280x720, bordered, centre crop.
//   match the window and the swapchain both become the SOURCE size, borderless.
//         One CopyTextureRegion, 1:1, whole frame, nothing resampled anywhere.
//         Clamped to the monitor if the source is larger.
//   fit   borderless at the MONITOR's size with the swapchain still at source
//         size, so DXGI scales on presentation. Fills the screen; the scaling is
//         the compositor's, not ours, and the banner says so rather than
//         claiming a 1:1 crop it no longer is.
//
// Any failure falls back to the existing chain and says which step failed. A
// window that is the wrong size is a cosmetic problem; a chain that has been
// half torn down is not.
// P7.3. DEFECT H - THE COLOURS. The bridge window showed flashing colour noise
// and never the game, from the first frame, on Tainted Grail.
//
// The bridge's swapchain is created R10G10B10A2_UNORM, hardcoded at P5.0
// because THAT game rendered R10G10B10A2 and the comment there says exactly why
// it must match: "CopyTextureRegion requires the two formats to match exactly -
// there is no conversion in a copy". That reasoning was right and the constant
// was the bug. The format was pinned to one title's backbuffer and then never
// asked again. Tainted Grail renders R8G8B8A8_UNORM - the arm line says so,
// fmt=28 - so the copy pushed 8-bit-per-channel bytes into a 10:10:10:2
// destination. Same 32 bits per pixel, completely different channel boundaries:
// every pixel is reinterpreted, and reinterpreted garbage that changes with the
// scene is precisely "colours blinking, never the game".
//
// It survived this long because every earlier test title happened to render
// R10G10B10A2. The invariant "the chain matches the source" was true by
// coincidence, and a coincidence that holds is indistinguishable from a
// constraint that is enforced - until the coincidence stops.
//
// Two things follow. The chain now takes the SOURCE's format, from the seal,
// which is the only authority on what the game actually rendered. And the
// resize is no longer only a window-shape operation: a format mismatch has to
// be corrected in Window=crop too, where no geometry changes at all - which is
// why `mode == 0` no longer returns early on its own.

// P5.1. THE PRESENT GATE - the pipeline cleanup, and it is two fixes in one.
//
// The bridge's present loop ran at the display's refresh - 210 fps - and
// P5.0 copied a full frame into the backbuffer on every one of them, new
// or not. At 1600x900 that is ~1.2 GB/s of GPU 1 bandwidth spent
// re-showing frames already on screen, plus a DWM cross-adapter copy per
// present while GPU 1 is headless, on the SAME LINK the payload uses. The
// measurement arm was competing with itself.
//
// Now the loop presents only when a new neural frame exists - about 57 per
// second instead of 210, so three quarters of those copies and three
// quarters of that DWM traffic simply stop happening.
//
// AND IT FIXES THE PACING COUPLING FROM SECTION 05a AS A SIDE EFFECT. The
// consumer used to be polled once per present, so its cadence was the
// bridge swapchain's vsync - 3.23x the producer's rate on a 210 Hz panel
// and 1.01x on a 60 Hz one. Now the idle path blocks on the SHARED FENCE
// event for the next frame instead, with a short timeout as a backstop, so
// the consumer wakes when a frame actually lands and its rate no longer
// depends on what display GPU 1 is attached to.
//
// THE FENCE WAIT HAPPENS OUTSIDE THE LOCK. The stream mutex is taken by
// the event handler on the GAME'S render thread every frame; holding it
// across a wait is the one hazard in this add-on that can reach the
// application. The pointer and the target value are copied out under the
// lock, the lock is released, and only then does anything block.

// that has confounded half the measurements in this project.
//
// This works for one specific reason: P1.2 established that NGX parameters are
// LIVE PER EVALUATE (intensity 0.00 vs 1.60 changed 98.03% of pixels while the
// same-value control was byte-identical), and the pass loop sets them fresh
// every frame. So a value changed between frames takes effect on the very next
// one, with no rebuild, no re-arm and no relaunch.
//
// Bridge thread only, by construction: RegisterHotKey delivers WM_HOTKEY to the
// thread that registered it, which is the bridge thread, which is also the only
// thread that reads intensity[]. Nothing here needs a lock.

// ---- P6.4: the accessors the overlay panel drives ----

// BRIDGE THREAD ONLY is NOT true of these - the ReShade overlay callback runs
// on whichever thread presents the runtime it belongs to. So unlike the hotkey
// helpers above, these take the stream's lock. They are deliberately tiny and
// never block on anything: a UI callback that can stall is a UI callback that
// can stall a present.
//
// gpu1_context still names no ReShade and no ImGui type. The panel lives in
// dllmain.cpp, where those headers already are, and talks to the stream through
// plain scalars - the same rule that has kept this file portable since T3.

// ======= V32: RELEASE THE NGX FEATURES WHEN THE GAME CLOSES =======
//
// THE BUG THIS FIXES, STATED PLAINLY: nothing released them. `stream_release()`
// has exactly two callers - a failed arm, and a stream that reached its own
// frame bound - and neither of those is what happens when a player closes the
// game. Every ordinary exit left alive, on GPU 1:
//
//   - two DLSS-NR feature handles
//   - one DLSS Super Resolution feature handle
//   - both NGX parameter blocks
//   - the driver's nvngx_dlss.dll, LoadLibrary'd by us
//
// and then `gpu1::shutdown()` released the D3D12 DEVICE those features were
// created against. Releasing a device out from under live NGX features is the
// oldest rule in this file broken at the very last step, every single run.
//
// WHY IT ONLY BIT AFTER SUPER RESOLUTION EXISTED. NR alone leaked the same way
// for months without a second-launch crash. SR added a SECOND NGX consumer on
// that device, with its own parameter block, created against a snippet DLL the
// game does not otherwise use. Whatever driver-side state survives a process,
// two abandoned consumers are not the same as one.
//
// AND IT EXPLAINS THE SHAPE NOTHING ELSE DID: first launch clean, second
// launch dead in CreateFeature; unaffected by AutoArm, depth, passes, Reflex;
// cleared by opening the NVIDIA app, which resets exactly this kind of state.
// The FAIL_OutOfDate on the line above every crash is a SYMPTOM of the
// previous session, not a cause of this one - which is why guarding on it
// (V29, V30) prevented the crash and fixed nothing.

// Order matters and it is the same order the rest of this file uses: the

    // closed, because "the OS reclaims it at process exit" had been assumed
    // and never checked.
    //
    // THAT THEORY IS DISPROVEN. Proven 2026-09-13 with our own NGX code
    // provably disabled - the log carried "[P1.0c] SKIPPED - recovery launch"
    // and "[P4.0] arm REFUSED" - and the snippet initialised anyway, on the
    // GAME'S thread, 1.5 seconds before our bridge thread existed. The cause
    // was nvngx_dlssnr.dll sitting beside the executable where the title's
    // Streamline scans for it. Our own install instructions put it there. The
    // session was never the problem, and closing it was never the fix.
    //
    // AND THE CALL ITSELF KILLS THE PROCESS. Three times on the record:
    //   P1.0b            - faulted inside Shutdown1, which is why it was
    //                      removed in the first place;
    //   V44, 2026-09-13  - called after a caught CreateFeature fault, took
    //                      the process down one millisecond later;
    //   Dawnwalker, 2026-09-13 - a CLEAN teardown. Features released, both
    //                      parameter blocks destroyed, both Success, then
    //                      EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION writing 0x0 two frames

//       beside the executable, so the title cannot load it and NGX binds to
//       the adapter we pass.
//   1 = THE BUG. A copy sits beside the executable. The title's Streamline
//       scans that folder and binds NGX to the game's GPU before our thread
//       exists. Whether a private copy also exists does not make this safe to
//       ignore - it works, but the user is one file away from the crash and
//       should be told.
//   2 = nvngx_dlssnr.dll is nowhere we can find it. Neural rendering cannot
//       start at all.
//
// Filesystem only - no LoadLibrary, no NGX - so the panel can call it on the
// first frame it draws, long before anything arms, and in a recovery launch
// where NGX is deliberately untouched.

//
// RESTORED IN V37, AND THE REASON IT WAS EVER REMOVED IS WORTH KEEPING.
//
// Reflex was cut in V35 because it looked like the cause of a crash that
// poisoned the NEXT launch of the game. It was not. The cause was that this
// add-on NEVER CLOSED ITS NGX SESSION - NVSDK_NGX_D3D12_Shutdown1 was
// deliberately not called on the reasoning that "one NGX session per launch,
// reclaimed by the OS at process exit, is the intended end state". The OS does
// not reclaim it. V36 calls Shutdown1 after releasing every feature, and the
// second-launch crash went away.
//
// Reflex looked guilty because turning it off appeared to fix things - but
// Reflex=0 meant "do not call", so those runs simply had a different NGX
// history, and because REBUILDING THE ADD-ON ALSO CLEARS THE RESIDUE, every
// first launch after a build was clean whatever the ini said. That combination
// produced a false positive that survived several hours.
//
// The teardown work written while chasing it is KEPT, because it is correct on
// its own terms even though it fixed nothing: we restore the sleep mode we set
// (V33) and pair NvAPI_Initialize with NvAPI_Unload (V34). Leaving a driver
// mode set on a user's device after they close the game is wrong regardless of
// whether it is the thing that crashes.

    //     presents too, from the bridge thread, which already holds the present
    //     chain's lock - so the device could be GPU 1's and the lock order was
    //     inverted. Reflex has to be set on GPU 0, and only GPU 0.

// it during the scene and has bound it as a render target again by the time
// effects run, so finish_effects - where colour and depth are copied - is too
// late to read it. R70 identified it by ranking binds 720:1 for exactly this
// reason; this is the other half of that finding put to use.
//
// THE BARRIER IS THE CALLER'S. The probe issues render_target -> copy_source
// and back around this call, because that transition belongs to a ReShade
// type and this file holds none - the same boundary rule the depth copy
// follows, and the same one P10.3 spent a device learning.
//
// THE SLOT IS KNOWABLE HERE, and this is the only subtle part. All this
// function does is record a copy into THE SLOT THIS FRAME IS ABOUT TO SEAL.
// stream_on_finish_effects will use fi = produced + 1 and slot = (fi - 1) %
// RING, which is produced % RING - read here under the same mutex, before the
// frame is sealed, so the two cannot disagree.
//
// ORDERING IS FREE. This copy is recorded into the game's list mid-scene and
// the seal is recorded at finish-effects; command lists execute in submission
// order, so the vectors are in the slot before the seal that describes them,
// and the single fence signal covers both.

    // the application, and it cost 60 -> 49.8 fps when it did.
    //
    // The consumer's critical sections are short and hold no waits since
    // DEFECT E was fixed, so contention here should be rare. But "should be

    // invisible - the seal says so, the model is handed none, and the next
    // frame is normal. A stall in the middle of the scene is not invisible.

// hang on GPU 1, in the file that is the whole bridge.
//
// TWO D3D12 RULES SHAPE THIS AND BOTH ARE EASY TO GET WRONG.
//
// 1. A COPY QUEUE CANNOT DO THE BARRIER. The states allowed on
//    D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_COPY are COMMON / COPY_DEST / COPY_SOURCE, and
//    NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE - the only state this project has ever handed
//    NGX an input in - is not among them. The transition therefore lives on
//    the DIRECT queue, after its Wait on cqf. R26 named this one.
//
// 2. THE BARRIER'S BEFORE-STATE IS COMMON, NOT COPY_DEST. R26 wrote
//    COPY_DEST -> NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE; that is wrong and the difference
//    is not cosmetic. D3D12 DECAYS every resource a COPY queue accessed back
//    to COMMON when that ExecuteCommandLists completes, and the promotion into
//    COPY_DEST for the copy itself is implicit and does not survive it. A
//    barrier claiming COPY_DEST would be naming a state the resource is not
//    in: the debug layer flags it, and a release build accepts it in silence -
//    which is the shape of bug this project keeps paying for. So tex_in rests
//    in COMMON in this mode, is read as NON_PIXEL_SHADER_RESOURCE on the
//    direct queue, and is put back to COMMON at the end of that list, ready
//    for the copy queue to take it again two frames later.
